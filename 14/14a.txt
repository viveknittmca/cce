Completeness: When many solutions exist for a problem, Will the algorithm(heuristic) guarantee in finding 
              atleast ONE solution ?
              If then the algorithm is Complete else Incomplete.
Optimality  : When many solutions exist for a problem, Will the algorithm(heuristic) guarantee in finding
              the BEST solution ?
              If then the algorithm is Optimal else Unoptimal
