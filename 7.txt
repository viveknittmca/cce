	         Deductive  Reasoning (Top Down Strategy)	            Inductive Reasoning (Bottom Up Strategy) 
Definition  The process of reasoning from one or more general        The process of constructing or evaluating general 
            statements regarding what is known to reach a            propositions that are derived from specific examples.
            logically certain conclusion	 
            
            
Approach    It works from the more general to the more specific.     It works by moving from specific observations to 
            Informally called as "top-down" approach                 broader generalizations and theories. Informally, 
                                                                     called as "bottom up" approach 
            
	    We might begin with thinking up a theory about our       We begin with specific observations and measures, 
	    topic of interest. We then narrow that down into         begin to detect patterns and regularities, formulate
	    more specific hypotheses that we can test.               tentative hypotheses that we can explore, and finally
	    We narrow down even further when we collect              end up developing some general conclusions/theories.
	    observations to address the hypotheses.

Argument    Arguments are either Valid or Invalid (Based on          Arguments are either Strong or Weak (Based on Degree  
 Types      of Correctness of Inference) &                           Support provided by Premises) &
            Can be Sound/Unsound. 	                             Can be Cogent/Uncogent. 
            
            Invalid arguments are always Unsound.                    Weak arguments are always Uncogent. 
            Valid arguments are sound only if the premises           Strong arguments are Cogent only if the premises
            they are based upon are true.	                     they are based upon are true.
            
Examples    Valid: All men are Mortal. Socrates is a Man             Strong: There are 100 apples. 95 are Ripe. 
                   =>  Socrates is Mortal	                             => All apples are Ripe  
	    If it rains today, then roads will be wet tommorow.      Weak : There are 100 apples. 5 are Ripe  
            Modus Ponens:                                                   => All apples are Ripe 
                It rains today                                              (Degree of support from Premisesis very less)
                => Roads will be wet tomorrow.                      	
            Modus Tollens: 
               The roads are NOT wet today                     
               => It did NOT rain yesterday"
